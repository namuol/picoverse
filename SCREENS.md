## Unruly Passenger :trollface:

Crew/passengers can become agitated for various reasons.

You must choose what to do with them.

You can attempt to restrain them and hold them in a cell (if you have one).

Or you can jettison them and face those consequences.

Certain passengers are more likely to be unruly.

TODO

## Mysterious Happening :ghost:

Maybe just simple messages on the screen for when a strange kind of alien silently boards the ship.

Perhaps the ship's computer could be "possessed", etc.

TODO

## Rogue Planet :earth_asia:

In deep space, you detect a large body floating out of orbit of any star.

A rogue planet.

How did it get here?
